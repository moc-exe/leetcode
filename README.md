## Getting Started

Welcome to my leetcode repos

## Folder Structure


- `JS`: contains challenges solved in JavaScript
- `SQL`: contains problem solutions for SQL problems (mostly SQL50, for which I earned a badge)
- `pandas`: has problems I solved as a pandas practice for my data analyst internship back in winter 2025.
- `src`: is for challenges I solved using Java. (simply .java files, no project build, nothing)
